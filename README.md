# Blink(1) OSX shortcut apps
### Shortcut apps to change the color of your Blink(1) USB light.

I use the great [Blink(1)](http://blink1.thingm.com/) USB multi-color LED light to subtly tell to my colleagues when I'm available or not while working (so, if they can interrupt me or not).
But I was tired to launch the official control panel to change the light according to my status, so I used AppleScript to code a few simple apps to quickly switch between colors.

You just have to put unzip the Blink(1) folder into your Applications folder and then to drop it on your Dock, to get a shortcut lanchpad like this:

Here are the color "codes" for me:
- Green = Available
- Red = Do not disturb
- Orange = In a meeting
- Blue = Having a coffee


I've even made a small label to caption all the different color states :

I've also added workflows for [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) to activate the different colors and to switch off the light as well.

Don't hesitate to [ping me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/skynebula) if you have any question...

PS: Thanks to [Julien](https://github.com/JulienRamel) for the help :)
